The most important part is the trekking, where I faced many difficulties but still sreekanth(trek lead)who helped me a lot in all the ways he can. The only reason to reach the view was him. The team helped us in all the ways. The stay and the food was also too good. Campfire was also a added fun. Thoroughly enjoyed the 2whole days trip. Thank you backpackers united..!!',
